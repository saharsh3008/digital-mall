# Digital Mall OS - Success Metrics (KPIs)

*As a data-driven product, success is measured not just by app usage, but by the physical outcomes driven by the software.*

## 1. North Star Metric
### **Digital Penetration Rate (%)**
*   **Definition:** (Unique Digital Users / Total Mall Footfall) * 100.
*   **Why it matters:** This tells us if the "OS" is actually becoming the operating system of the mall. If 100,000 people visit the mall, but only 500 use the OS, we are a toy, not a platform.

## 2. Customer (Shopper) Metrics
### **A. Wayfinding Success Rate**
*   **Definition:** % of "Search for Store" sessions that result in a "Navigate" or "Arrive" action (vs. abandoning the app).
*   **Why it matters:** The primary MVP utility is eliminating friction. If they search but don't find, the map/directory failed.

### **B. Offer Wallet Save Rate**
*   **Definition:** % of Viewed Offers that are "Saved" or "Added to Wallet".
*   **Why it matters:** Indicates intent to purchase. It moves the user from "Browsing" to "Planning to Buy."

### **C. Parking Friction Score**
*   **Definition:** Average time spent finding a spot usage of the "Find My Car" feature.
*   **Why it matters:** Parking is the #1 deterrent for physical malls. Reducing this time directly improves Net Promoter Score (NPS).

## 3. Store Owner (Tenant) Metrics
### **A. Digital-to-Physical Conversion**
*   **Definition:** Number of coupon redemptions / Number of unique coupon views.
*   **Why it matters:** This is the ROI metric for tenants. It proves that the OS drives actual sales, justifying their participation (and potential future subscription fees).

### **B. Tenant Engagement Frequency**
*   **Definition:** Days per week a store manager logs into the Tenant Portal.
*   **Why it matters:** A "Ghost Town" portal leads to outdated hours and stale offers. We need sticky B2B tools.

### **C. "Near Me" Discovery Rate**
*   **Definition:** Number of times a store appears in a "Near Me" or category search result.
*   **Why it matters:** Shows the tenant the "free" exposure they are getting just by being on the platform.

## 4. Mall Management (Operator) Metrics
### **A. Yield Per Square Foot (Attributed)**
*   **Definition:** Total tenant sales attributed to Digital Mall OS promotions / Total Mall Area.
*   **Why it matters:** The ultimate metric for a landlord. It justifies higher rents or revenue-share models in the future.

### **B. Churn of Shoppers (Frequency)**
*   **Definition:** Average days elapsed between visits for OS-users vs Non-OS users.
*   **Why it matters:** We hypothesize that digitized users (who get offer notifications and easy parking) visit more often. We need to prove this lift.

### **C. Data Enrichment %**
*   **Definition:** % of physical visitors for whom we have a captured email or phone number.
*   **Why it matters:** Turns anonymous foot traffic into a marketable database (CRM), building a defensive moat against competitors.
